I needed to:

    update database table column phpbb_users.user_password to store up to 255 characters
    copy /phpbb/passwords/driver/*
    copy /phpbb/config/config.php
    create a class which extends phpbb\config\config to make set() actually store data
    write my own code which
        always includes the files and creates instances of the classes that are always needed
        distinguishes from the hash which additional class(es) have to be included and instanciated
        patches /includes/functions.php in phpbb_hash() and phpbb_check_hash()

All the "drivers" are only there for backward compatibilty, especially for non-phpBB migrations (but also for i.e. phpBB3.0 and phpBB2) - only bcrypt is "interesting" to be used actively, nothing else.
