    1.1.1: 12.31.2006 ¡V
        For the "viewtopic.tpl", added "post reply" at the bottom of the template.

        Original width for Vision1 template is fixed pixel 780, change the overall_he-
        ader.tpl and overall_footer.tpl to be FULL SCALE version,

    1.1.2: 1.1.2007 ¡V
        Fixed double links "view unanswered post" in index.tpl

        Because of the user's suggestion, modified the header height to be smaller.
        modified Vision1.css

    1.2: 1.8.2007 -
        Fixed admin/index.tpl, admin/forum_admin_body.tpl, index_navigate.tpl
        Modified overall_header.tpl

        New Function: you can design your own header easier, only one step ---
        -- To change the background image of header !!
        "header_background.jpg" ( 780 x 160 )
        This image is in "/templates/Vision1/image/".

        Added a flash file for custom header.
        Added a javascript files for Internet Explorer Browser.

   1.3: 1.8.2007 night- 
        Fixed a problem on overall_header.tpl 

   1.3.1: 1.22
        There is a flaw in overall_header.tpl, 
        some javascripts have been removed and move the links to be the same line.
        It is the last modification I'm sure. 

        All icons in folder "lang_english", change to transparent icon
        It would look smoother in white backgrund fields in the memberlist and profile.

   1.4: 2.2
        A little change in privmsgs_read_body.tpl and Vision1.css
